# Code Review Checklist

Is the code in question:

- [ ] Easy to reason about, read and understand?
- [ ] Easy to maintain?
- [ ] Time-complexity efficient and optimised?
- [ ] Tested?

For re-usable code, such as Components, is the code:

- [ ] Composable with other code?
- [ ] Flexible where possible?
- [ ] Appropriately opinionated (e.g. an atom-level components should have zero opinion)?
- [ ] Concise and not polluted with business or other logic?

For test code, is the code:

- [ ] Removing the fear of changing the source code?
- [ ] Correctly describing the requirements of the source code?
- [ ] Explaining the source code?
- [ ] Easy to maintain?

## Reasoning and philosophy

This list is currently entirely subjective. It's a combination of personal thoughts and views based on my experiences but is also influenced by the progamming and open source community, plus many brilliant colleagues and peers.
